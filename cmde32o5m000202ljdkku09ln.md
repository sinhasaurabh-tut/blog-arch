## Important Reasons Why Cloud Migration is Essential

Cloud migration is essential for lowering costs, increasing agility, enhancing security, improving reliability, and enabling access to cutting-edge technology. Organizations migrate to the cloud to future-proof their IT, drive innovation, and remain competitive in a rapidly changing digital landscape.

Organizations choose cloud migration—moving their applications, data, and infrastructure from on-premises environments to cloud platforms—for several compelling reasons.

Below are the core motivations, supported by real-world benefits:

## Legacy Systems vs. Cloud Migration: Comparative Table

Below is a practical comparison across key topics—cost, scalability, security, performance, innovation, and operational efficiency—with example figures based on recent studies and industry benchmarks.

| **Topic** | **Legacy System Example** | **Cloud Migration Example** | **Improvement / Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cost Efficiency** | Annual maintenance: **$150,000** per app | Annual maintenance: **$90,000** per app (40% savings) | Pay-as-you-go model, reduced unnecessary expenses |
| **Scalability** | Hardware upgrades require **3-6 months** | Instantly scalable, add resources in **minutes** | Rapid expansion, no physical limitations |
| **Security** | Patch delays, risk of breaches | Automated patching; advanced monitoring; **23% fewer incidents** | Increased protection, continuous updates |
| **Performance & Reliability** | Uptime around **97-98%**; basic disaster recovery | Uptime **99.9-99.99%**; built-in failover & geo-redundancy | Higher availability, improved disaster recovery |
| **Business Agility & Innovation** | New deployments in **weeks or months** | Deploy in **hours/days**; quick experimentation | Faster go-to-market, rapid iteration capabilities |
| **Operational Efficiency** | **3-5 IT staff** required per app | **1-2 IT staff** per app; automation reduces workload | Smaller teams needed, focus on high-value activities |
| **Integration & Flexibility** | Tough API/data integration | Easy API support, seamless third-party integration | Faster digital transformation, improved interoperability |
| **3-Year Total Cost of Ownership** | **$500,000+** per app | **$320,000** per app (36% reduction) | Lower long-term spending on hardware, staff, and downtime |
